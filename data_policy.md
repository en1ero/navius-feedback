Privacy Policy for navius Chrome Extension

  This Privacy Policy describes how the "navius" Chrome Extension (the "Extension")
  handles your information.

  1. Data Collection and Storage

   * No Personal Data Collection: The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any
     personally identifiable information about you.
   * Local Data Storage: All data created and managed by the Extension, including your custom
     bookmark groups and bookmarks (titles and URLs), is stored exclusively on your local
     device (within your browser's local storage). This data is not sent to any external
     servers or third parties.
   * No Server Interaction: The Extension does not connect to any external servers for the
     purpose of storing, processing, or transmitting your data.

  2. Use of Information

   * The information you create (bookmark groups and bookmarks) is used solely within the
     Extension to provide its intended functionality: organizing and displaying your custom
     start page content.

  3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

   * Since no user data is collected or transmitted by the Extension, there is no data to
     share or disclose to third parties.

  4. Favicon Fetching

   * The Extension fetches favicons (small website icons) from
     https://www.google.com/s2/favicons based on the URLs of your bookmarks. This is done
     solely for visual display purposes within the Extension and does not involve the
     collection or transmission of your personal data or browsing history.

  5. Data Security

   * As all your data is stored locally on your device, its security is dependent on the
     security of your device and browser. The Extension does not implement additional
     server-side security measures as it does not handle data on a server.

  6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

   * We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes
     by updating the Privacy Policy within the Chrome Web Store listing for the Extension.

  7. Contact Us

   * If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the
     support link provided in the Chrome Web Store listing.
